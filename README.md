# Full Stack TypeScript Boilerplate

## Features
This monorepo acts as boilerplate for a full stack project written using TypeScript. 

The project as a whole uses a single Prettier configuration, while the client and server each have their own ESLint rules.

### Client
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) development tool
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) as a frontend library
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as a test framework

### Server
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime environment
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) as a backend framework
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as a test framework
- [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) as an assertion library for testing
